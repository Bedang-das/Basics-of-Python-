## 3. Theory

### 3.1 Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simple syntax and versatility. It is currently the leading language for:
* **Data Science & AI:** Powering libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
* **Web Development:** Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
* **Automation:** Scripting repetitive tasks efficiently.

### 3.2 The Anaconda Ecosystem
Anaconda is the world's most popular data science platform. It simplifies package management and deployment, handling dependencies automatically.

### 3.3 Why Python?
* **Readability:** Syntax resembles English, making it beginner-friendly.
* **Interpreted:** Code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies debugging.
* **Extensive Libraries:** Over 300,000+ packages available for nearly any task.

### 3.4 Why Jupyter Notebook?
* **Interactivity:** Allows you to run code in "cells" and see results immediately.
* **Documentation:** Supports Markdown for combining code, images, and text in one document.
* **EDA:** Ideally suited for Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization.
