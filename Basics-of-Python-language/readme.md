## 1. Aim
To study the basics of Python instructions, including variable definition, user input handling, arithmetic operations, and connecting these concepts to real-life examples such as a simple calculator.

## 2. Tools Used
* **Google Colab** (Cloud-based execution)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (Local execution)

## 3. Theory

### 3.1 Introduction & History
Python was introduced in **1991**. It is derived from several other languages, such as **C** and **SETL**. It was preferred over many existing languages due to its:
* Easy-to-read syntax.
* Easy-to-learn nature.
* Focus on development speed rather than just raw code execution speed.

### 3.2 Modules and Libraries
In Python, various modules or libraries can be imported to use pre-existing functions for specific operations. Common modules include:
* `math` – For mathematical operations.
* `random` – For generating random numbers.
* `Pandas` – For data manipulation and analysis.

### 3.3 Variables and Data Types
When a variable is declared in Python, the interpreter **automatically understands the data type** and assigns that class to it (Dynamic Typing).

* **Mutability:** In Python, the data type of a variable is generally *mutable*, meaning it can be changed anytime and anywhere inside the code.
* **Constants:** A Python constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed throughout the entire program.

### 3.4 Classification of Data Types
There are basically three categories of data types in Python:

1.  **Built-in Data Types:**
    * Numeric Types (int, float, complex)
    * Text Type (str)
    * Sequence Types (list, tuple, range)
    * Mapping Type (dict)
2.  **Mutability Comparison:**
    * Mutable (Lists, Dictionaries)
    * Immutable (Tuples, Strings)
3.  **Specialized Data Types:**
    * `datetime`
    * Collections
    * Arrays

### 3.5 Input and Output Handling
* **Input:** To get input from the user, the `input()` function is used.
    * For string input, no data type needs to be mentioned.
    * For integer, float, or boolean values, the data type must be specified (Type Casting).
    * *Example:* `int(input("Enter a number: "))`
* **Output:** To print results directly to the console, the `print()` function is used.

### 3.6 Operators
Python includes several types of operators, each performing unique functions:

1.  **Arithmetic Operations:** Used to perform mathematical calculations (+, -, *, /).
2.  **Assignment Operators:** Used to assign values to variables (e.g., `=`, `+=`).
3.  **Comparison Operators:** Used to compare two values (returns True/False).
4.  **Logical Operators:** Used to perform logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).
5.  **Bitwise Operators:** Similar to C programming, used to perform bit-level operations.

## 4. Learning Outcomes
By performing this experiment, we achieved the following:
1.  **Data Types:** We learnt about data mutability and immutability and the different data types falling into each category.
2.  **Type Casting:** We learned about converting data types and established that Python constants do not allow type casting.
3.  **Operations:** We performed arithmetic and logical operations on variables and built a **simple calculator**.
4.  **Interaction:** We understood how to handle user interaction (Input) and display results (Output).

## 5. Applications & Advantages

### Real-World Applications
Python is used across many platforms due to its easy handling and debugging. Notable examples include:
* **Streaming Services:** Netflix, Spotify (Algorithm optimization).
* **Space Agencies:** NASA, ISRO (Scientific data analysis).
* **Logistics:** Real-time calculations in transport systems.

### Advantages
* Rapid prototyping and iteration.
* Seamless integration with other languages.
* Dynamic typing for flexibility.
* Automated memory management.

## 6. Conclusion
Thus, the basic functions of Python programming have been successfully executed, and the output has been verified. The experiment provided a strong foundation in variable handling and operator usage.
