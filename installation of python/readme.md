## 📖 Theory

### 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted language known for its simple syntax and versatility. It has become the leading language for:
* **Data Science & AI:** Powering libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.
* **Web Development:** Using frameworks like Django and Flask.
* **Automation:** Scripting repetitive tasks efficiently.

### 2. The Anaconda Ecosystem
Anaconda is the world's most popular data science platform. It simplifies package management and deployment, making it easier to manage libraries and dependencies.

### Why Python?
* **Readability:** The syntax resembles English, making it extremely beginner-friendly.
* **Interpreted:** Code is executed line-by-line, which simplifies the debugging process.
* **Extensive Libraries:** There are over 300,000+ packages available for nearly any task.

### Why Jupyter Notebook?
* **Interactivity:** Allows you to run code in individual "cells" and see results immediately.
* **Documentation:** Supports Markdown for combining code, images, and text in a single document.
* **EDA:** Ideally suited for Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### A. Local Installation (Anaconda)
To set up the environment locally, I followed these steps:

1.  **Download:** Navigate to [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the installer for your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux).
2.  **Install:** Run the executable file and follow the setup wizard instructions.  
    *(Note: It is recommended to check the box to add Anaconda to your system PATH during installation).*
3.  **Launch:** Open the **Anaconda Navigator** application and click "Launch" under Jupyter Notebook.



### B. Cloud Execution (Google Colab)
For cloud-based execution without local installation:

1.  **Visit:** Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2.  **Sign In:** Log in using a Google account.
3.  **Create:** Click on "New Notebook" to start coding.



**Advantages of Colab:**
* No installation required.
* Free access to GPUs/TPUs.
* Easy collaboration with others.
* Runs entirely in the browser.
