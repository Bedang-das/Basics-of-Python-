## 📚 Theory

### 1. Introduction
Loops are essential control flow statements that allow a specific block of code to be executed repeatedly. This prevents code redundancy and allows for the efficient processing of data sequences. Each cycle of a loop is referred to as an **iteration**.

In Python, loops are primarily classified into two types based on their execution logic:
1. **For Loop** (Definite Iteration)
2. **While Loop** (Indefinite Iteration)



### 2. For Loops
A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string). It is most effective when the number of iterations is known in advance.

**The `range()` Function:**
The `range()` function is used to control the number of iterations. It consists of:
* **Start Value:** The index where the loop begins (default is `0`).
* **Stop Value:** The boundary where the loop stops (exclusive).
* **Step Value:** The increment between each iteration (default is `1`).

### 3. While Loops
A `while` loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains `True`. It is ideal for situations where the exact number of iterations is unknown and depends on dynamic data.

> **Note:** A while loop requires a terminating condition or an incrementer. Without this, the program will enter an **Infinite Loop**, which can cause the system to stop responding.

## 🚦 Loop Control Statements
These statements allow developers to interrupt or modify the standard flow of a loop:

| Statement | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`break`** | Terminates the loop entirely and moves to the next block of code outside the loop. |
| **`continue`** | Skips the current iteration and jumps directly to the next cycle. |
| **`pass`** | A null statement used as a placeholder; it prevents syntax errors when code is not yet written. |

## 🚀 Applications and Advantages

### Key Applications
* **Data Analysis:** Iterating through large datasets to filter or analyze specific parameters.
* **Cyber Security:** Running automated scripts for network scanning or vulnerability testing.
* **Signal Processing:** Processing frames of audio or sensor data (e.g., MATLAB/Python visualizations).
* **Web Development:** Dynamically rendering elements like product lists or user data.

### Advantages
* **Efficiency:** Reduces the amount of code required for repetitive tasks.
* **Scalability:** Handles data structures regardless of their size.
* **Automation:** Enables complex logic to run without manual intervention.

## 💡 Learning Outcomes
* Demonstrated proficiency in using **For Loops** for sequence iteration.
* Understood the necessity of logical boundaries in **While Loops**.
* Applied **Control Statements** to manage execution flow effectively.

## 🏁 Conclusion
